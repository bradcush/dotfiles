# Key bindings
#
# Key bindings are specified as a list of objects.
# For example, this is the default paste binding:
# `- { key: V, mods: Control|Shift, action: Paste }`
#
# Bindings are always filled by default, but will be replaced when a new
# binding with the same triggers is defined. To unset a default binding, it can
# be mapped to the `ReceiveChar` action. Alternatively, you can use `None` for
# a no-op if you do not wish to receive input characters for that binding.
#
# If the same trigger is assigned to multiple
# actions, all of them are executed at once.
key_bindings:
  # (macOS only)
  # Map CTRL-6 to CTRL-^ which isn't working by default
  - { key: Key6, mods: Control, chars: "\x1e" }
